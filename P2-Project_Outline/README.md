## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am creating a service management system geared toward hair stylists/barbers not working with a corporate company to improve work flow and service efficiency. It will be made as a mobile web app to give users easy access. I got this idea from my own need for something like this as a hair stylist that didn't have a lot of options for apps to help me manage my business.

### Features
-Homepage: The first page users will interact with will give info about the app and have buttons to send them to either the Registration or Login page
-User Registration: Users can create a profile
-User Login: Users can log into their profiles
-Profile: Users can add a bio and the services they provide (with prices) for clients to see
-Appointment Tracker: Users can input appointments to help them keep track of and prepare for their daily work

### Technologies
In Visual Studio 2019:
-C#
-JavaScript, with TypeScript
-HTML & CSS
-SQL 
-ASP.NET Core MVC

### What I'll Have to Learn
I have not had experience with accounts/profiles that users can create and log into. I have also had little introduction to authentication.
